Mohammed bin Salman's relationships with world leaders have undergone a remarkable transformation, reflecting his ruthless pragmatism and ambition to reposition Saudi Arabia globally. Initially shunned by Western leaders following journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder, MBS has engineered a stunning rehabilitation, leveraging Saudi Arabia's energy dominance to force a reluctant reconciliation with Biden, maintain strong ties with France's Macron, and establish close coordination with the UK's leadership on defense and investment. His relationship with Russia's Putin balances OPEC+ oil production coordination against Western pressure, while he's cultivated an increasingly warm partnership with China's Xi Jinping based on energy security and infrastructure investment. Regionally, MBS has dramatically shifted from confrontation to de-escalation, reconciling with Turkey's Erdoğan after years of hostility, pursuing normalized relations with Israel's Netanyahu, engaging in pragmatic dialogue with Iran's leadership after a Chinese-brokered détente, maintaining support for Egypt's el-Sisi, and working to end the Yemen conflict with limited coordination with Houthi leadership. His once-close relationship with UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed has evolved into a more competitive partnership as both pursue similar economic diversification visions, while he's asserted Saudi dominance over smaller Gulf states including Qatar's leadership following the end of the Gulf blockade. MBS has carefully maintained ties with India's Modi and Pakistan's leadership simultaneously despite their rivalries, part of his broader strategy to position Saudi Arabia as an influential middle power cultivating relationships across traditional divides based strictly on Saudi national interests rather than historical alliances or ideological affinities.
