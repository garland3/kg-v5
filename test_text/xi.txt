Xi Jinping's relationships with world leaders reflect his vision of China as a dominant global power deserving respect while advancing Chinese interests. His closest partnership is with Russia's Vladimir Putin, strengthened by their shared authoritarian governance and opposition to Western hegemony, though he's maintained strategic ambiguity regarding Russia's Ukraine invasion. Xi has cultivated economic dependencies with numerous Global South leaders through his signature Belt and Road Initiative, forging particularly strong ties with Pakistan's leadership, Cambodia's Hun Sen, and various African leaders including South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa. His relationship with American presidents has deteriorated over timeâ€”from relatively stable engagement with Obama to open hostility with Trump and cautious but increasingly competitive positioning with Biden. Xi has systematically pressured European leaders including Germany's Scholz and France's Macron to separate economic cooperation from human rights concerns, while adopting an increasingly assertive stance toward neighboring countries, intimidating Taiwan's Lai Ching-te, pressuring the Philippines' Marcos Jr. over maritime disputes, maintaining frosty relations with Japan's leadership, and leveraging North Korea's Kim Jong Un as a strategic buffer despite ideological differences. Throughout these relationships, Xi consistently positions himself as the primary champion of developing nations against Western powers while demanding recognition of China's territorial claims and political system as beyond legitimate criticism.
