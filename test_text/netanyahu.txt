Benjamin Netanyahu's relationships with world leaders reflect his lengthy tenure and willingness to leverage Israel's security concerns, technological prowess, and strategic position for diplomatic advantage, often generating both notable breakthroughs and significant friction. His relationship with American presidents has fluctuated dramatically—maintaining close alignment with Trump while experiencing profound tensions with Obama and increasingly strained relations with Biden over Gaza policy and West Bank settlements, though security cooperation remains robust. Netanyahu's engagement with European leaders, particularly France's Macron and Germany's Scholz, combines appreciation for their security support with frustration over their criticisms of Israeli military operations and settlement policies. His greatest diplomatic achievement has been the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations with UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed, Bahrain's King Hamad, and Morocco's King Mohammed VI, while more recently pursuing potential normalization with Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman despite increasing complications from the Gaza conflict. Netanyahu has cultivated a complex working relationship with Russia's Putin focused on preventing conflicts in Syria while maintaining Israeli freedom of action, a balancing act complicated by Russia's partnerships with Iran and growing ties to Hamas. He has forged increasingly close relations with India's Modi based on defense sales, counter-terrorism cooperation, and technology transfer, while simultaneously developing unprecedented ties with China's Xi Jinping focused on infrastructure investment and technology cooperation, creating tension with American allies. His relationship with Egypt's el-Sisi and Jordan's King Abdullah balances crucial security cooperation against public criticism, particularly during Gaza operations, while his interactions with Turkey's Erdoğan have swung between reconciliation and bitter recrimination depending on regional dynamics. With Palestinian leaders including Abbas and Hamas leadership, Netanyahu has maintained minimal contact while pursuing a strategy of conflict management rather than resolution. His relationships with Gulf leaders beyond the Abraham Accords signatories have evolved from covert intelligence cooperation to increasingly open engagement based on shared concerns about Iran, while his approach to European leaders has increasingly emphasized relationships with Hungary's Orbán and other governments less critical of Israeli policies over traditional Western European allies.
