Narendra Modi's relationships with world leaders showcase his pragmatic balancing act of asserting India's strategic autonomy while pursuing national interests across ideological divides. He has maintained India's historic relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin despite Western pressure following the Ukraine invasion, continuing defense cooperation and energy purchases while subtly encouraging peace efforts. Simultaneously, Modi has dramatically strengthened ties with Western leaders, building a particularly close partnership with successive U.S. presidents, evidenced through enhanced military cooperation, technology transfers with Biden, and personal chemistry with Trump during his presidency. He has cultivated strong bonds with Japan's leadership through the Quad alliance, deepened defense ties with France's Macron, and pursued improved relations with Australia's leadership after years of tension. Modi's approach to China's Xi Jinping has shifted from early engagement to heightened caution following border clashes, while he's balanced regional relationships by maintaining strong connections with Israel's Netanyahu, deepened engagement with UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed and Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, and attempted to stabilize historically complex ties with neighboring leaders including Bangladesh's Hasina (before her fall), Sri Lanka's leadership, and a cautious approach to Pakistan's government. His "Neighborhood First" policy has aimed to counter Chinese influence in South Asia, while his "Act East" initiative has strengthened ties with ASEAN leaders, with Modi consistently positioning himself as representing the Global South in interactions with G7 leadership while simultaneously seeking greater global recognition for India's rising power status.
