Joko Widodo's relationships with world leaders have been characterized by his pragmatic, non-ideological approach focused on economic development and positioning Indonesia as a respected middle power while maintaining its traditional non-aligned stance. With major powers, he has skillfully balanced ties between the United States, China, and Russia, maintaining productive relations with Biden centered on economic cooperation and climate initiatives while simultaneously deepening economic engagement with Xi Jinping through China's Belt and Road investments in Indonesian infrastructure, and preserving cordial relations with Putin despite Western pressure following the Ukraine invasion. Within ASEAN, Widodo has positioned Indonesia as a diplomatic leader, working closely with Singapore's Lee Hsien Loong, Malaysia's successive Prime Ministers, and Vietnam's leadership to maintain regional unity amid U.S.-China tensions, while taking a firm stance against Myanmar's military junta following the 2021 coup. His relationship with Australia's leadership evolved from early tensions over executions and refugee policy to more constructive engagement on trade and security with successive Prime Ministers. Widodo has strengthened ties with Middle Eastern leaders, particularly Saudi Arabia's MBS and UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed, focusing on investment and migrant worker protections, while developing connections with African leaders through the Bandung spirit of South-South cooperation. He has cultivated productive relationships with Japan's leadership and South Korea's Presidents centered on infrastructure investment and manufacturing partnerships, maintained balanced relations with European leaders including Merkel, Macron, and von der Leyen focused on trade and climate cooperation, and deepened ties with India's Modi through mutual recognition of their democratic developmental models. In multilateral contexts, Widodo has engaged constructively with UN leadership and asserted greater Indonesian influence through Indonesia's G20 presidency, where he successfully navigated intense geopolitical divisions while keeping focus on economic recovery and sustainable development. Throughout these diverse relationships, Widodo has consistently projected Indonesia's distinctive diplomatic identity as the world's largest Muslim-majority democracy committed to pluralism, moderation, and peaceful dispute resolution, while prioritizing concrete economic benefits for Indonesia's development over ideological positioning.
