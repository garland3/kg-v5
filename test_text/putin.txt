Vladimir Putin's relationships with world leaders reflect his strategic approach to expanding Russian influence while balancing pragmatism and confrontation. With China's Xi Jinping, he's cultivated a deep "no limits" partnership based on mutual opposition to Western dominance. Putin maintains strong ties with authoritarian-leaning leaders including Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Serbia's Aleksandar Vučić, while his relationships with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Lula da Silva have emphasized practical cooperation despite ideological differences. His interactions with Western leaders have deteriorated dramatically - once enjoying relatively warm relations with Germany's Angela Merkel and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, he now faces unified opposition from Biden, Macron, Scholz, and Starmer following the Ukraine invasion. In the Middle East, Putin has solidified alliances with Syria's Bashar al-Assad, Iran's leadership, and balanced relationships with rivals Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman and Israel's Netanyahu. His manipulation of Belarus's Lukashenko and strained relations with former Soviet states like Kazakhstan's Tokayev highlight his determination to maintain influence in what he considers Russia's sphere of interest, though many leaders now approach him with growing wariness.
