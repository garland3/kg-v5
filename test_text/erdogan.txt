Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's relationships with world leaders reflect his assertive pursuit of Turkish interests through strategic ambiguity and transactional diplomacy that defies traditional alliance structures. Within NATO, he has maintained a complex and often contentious relationship with American presidents, particularly clashing with Biden over human rights concerns while leveraging Turkey's strategic position to extract concessions. His dealings with European leaders, especially Germany's Scholz and France's Macron, are characterized by perpetual tension over migration, Eastern Mediterranean disputes, and EU accession, though economic ties remain substantial. Erdoğan has cultivated a carefully calibrated relationship with Russia's Putin that balances competition in Syria, Libya, and the South Caucasus with cooperation on energy, defense procurement, and tourism, frustrating his Western allies. With Ukraine's Zelensky, he's positioned Turkey as both a military supporter and potential mediator, maintaining open channels to both sides of the conflict. In the Middle East, Erdoğan has executed dramatic diplomatic reversals, reconciling with former rivals UAE's Mohammed bin Zayed, Saudi Arabia's MBS, and Egypt's el-Sisi after years of ideological confrontation, while maintaining support for Qatar's leadership during the Gulf crisis. His once-friendly relationship with Israel's leadership has deteriorated dramatically over Gaza, while his engagement with Iran's government remains pragmatic despite regional competition. In Central Asia, he has deepened cultural and economic ties with Turkic leaders in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, promoting a vision of pan-Turkic solidarity. His relationship with China's Xi Jinping prioritizes economic benefits while downplaying earlier criticism of Uyghur treatment, exemplifying Erdoğan's willingness to subordinate ideological considerations to practical advantages when necessary for Turkish interests.
